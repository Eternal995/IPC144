1.
The user-defined types helps organize variables and make coding less complex.
by using the structures used in this workshop, we can just declare variables like:

    struct GameInfo gameinfo = { 0,0,{0},{0} };
    struct PlayerInfo playerinfo = { ' ',0,0,{0}};

if not using the struct we would have to declare each one of the variables seperately, which is time consuming and not effective.
and by using the struct we only need to declare one single variable and it's easier to remember.

2.
to keep a history of games played and endgame result, we would need to need to created a new variable for the struct GameInfo and PlayerInfo
for each round of the game played. so we will need to create a loop that including the game configuration part and the game play part. 
and then we would need to declare the struct into an array like struct GameInfo gameinfo[rounds] (not sure if this is possible). so each round of the 
game can be stored in each index of the array.

3.
the most time consuming thing is the loop for playing the game, since there are so many small loops and conditions inside the game
play loop, it's really easy to mass those up, so what I do is to always test the part I just wrote and make sure everything works
before I going into the next small loop, it's more about patiently going over the code.
