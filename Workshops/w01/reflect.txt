1. 
In completing this workshop I first learned how to create and working on new project in Visual Studio,
then from doing the codes, I learned the use of the printf funtion to print out texts, 
how to start out a new line, how to to tab space in a line, and how to insert characters like '\', '"','%'.
Then also I learned how to use PuTTy to connect to Matrix and submit work, 
and how to use WinSCP to upload files onto matrix.

2.
SSH is stand for Secure Shell Protocol, it enables connection to matrix, which is an server located in Seneca.
In this workshop the SSH client helps submit files, the way I did this is by using a SFTP to upload those files
on to the matrix, and then use commands listed in the pdf file to submit those files.

3.
SFTP is stand for SSH File Transfer Protocal, it can access and transfer files on a server.
I used SFTP in this workshop to upload files to matrix which is needed to do submission.
