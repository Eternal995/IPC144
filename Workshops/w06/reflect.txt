1.

printf("%3d %6d %8c %14.2lf\n", i + 1, importance[i], financing[i], cost[i]);
is an example using parallel arrays, to link related date we need to have the array be
same length, then we use the same index to represent the same set of data.

2.

It usually start with zero because when working with for loop, it will make counting easier
since for loop also usually start with 0

for example

            for (i = 0; i < wish_list; i++)
            {
                if (importance[i] == prio_selection) priority_total += cost[i];
            }
by starting with zero, we dont need to think of adding or subtract 1 during the loop since they all start with 0.


3.
think of array as a parking lot, each position in array is a parking spot, and the data stored in the array is 
the car parking in the parking spot, if you want to accessing an element in the array, it's the same that you go to 
the desired parking spot and see what car is parking in there, and there can be no car parking there too.
